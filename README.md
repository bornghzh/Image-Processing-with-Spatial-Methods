# Image Processing with Spatial Methods
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates various image processing techniques using spatial methods. It includes 2D convolutions with specific kernel matrices and observes their effects on images. The notebook guides you through reading an image file and applying different filters to understand the impact of each convolution operation.
